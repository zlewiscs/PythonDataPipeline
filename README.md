# PythonDataPipeline

## Project Overview
This personal project is undertaken with the purpose of learning about data processing and analytics for the first time. The project should help with familiarising with popular data processing and analytics frameworks such as pandas and pyTorch. Ideally some machine learning models will be incorporated at later stage as skill allows

## Data Source
The data source for this project should be completely open for use for any purpose, hence a open dataset should be chosen. Currently the dataset in mind is from the International Energy Agency titied "Critical Minerals Demand Dataset" (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/critical-minerals-demand-dataset). Depending on difficulty, a more simple or chanllenging dataset will be chosen. There is no particular reason for choosing this dataset other than the fact that it was easy to get my hands on.

## Tools
The programming language is intended to be python. At this stage my knowledge is rather limited in terms of data processing and analytics framework provided so no choices will be made yet. The plan is to learn about the popular frameworks by reading their documentation and determine the most suitable one.
