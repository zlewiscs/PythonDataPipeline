# PythonDataPipeline

## Project Overview
This project is a personal undertaking with the purpose of learning about data processing and analytics for the first time. The project should help with familiarising with popular data processing and analytics frameworks such as pandas and pyTorch. Ideally some machine learning models will be incorporated at later stage as skill allows

## Data Source
TBC
## Tools
The programming language is intended to be python. At this stage my knowledge is rather limited in terms of data processing and analytics framework provided so no choices will be made yet. The plan is to learn about the popular frameworks by reading their documentation and determine the most suitable one.
